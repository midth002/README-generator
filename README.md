  ## Description

  One thing as an aspiring developer we all have to have in our repos is a Readme file. A readme is a markdown file that includes all sorts of information about a specific project. In this project for myself, I created a readme generator to make creating readme for specific developer projects be more automated and user friendly. This is a command line application that if you want to use it has to be accessed through a command line terminal. Users will be prompted questions on what they would like to include in their readme file. Details include giving your Github username, user email, the project title, a description of the project, what kind of license you will use (or none if not), any kind of dependencies to run on the terminal or tests to run and how to use and contribute to the project."
  
  ## Installation 

  To install the necessary dependencies, run the following command:
  
  ```Dependencies
   npm i
  ```  
  ## Usage

  When using this repo, notice that this is a command line application. Thus, you will need to access the terminal to the specific folder location of this project to use. You will need to answer the questions to create a beautiful readme.md file.
